  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>While we do not collect user data, the App integrates with the following third-party services:</p>

  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised from our end. However, we rely on third-party services for purchases and crash reporting, which have their own security measures.</p>
  <p></p>

  <p>The App is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>
